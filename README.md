# Chess-Clock
A chess clock with 9 different pre-programmed time controls. Includes pausing functionality, special responses to running out of time, lights to indictate whos turn it is, and easy resetting.
Notes:
- To reset, hold down the "select time control" button.
- To pause on your turn, press the button for the other player.
- pins 2 and 3 are the only interrupt pins, so we are only using interrupts for
the white and black move buttons.
